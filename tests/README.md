# Tests

Run the C++ regression tests from any working directory:

```bash
bash /path/to/tuntom/tests/run.sh
```

Requires a C++17 compiler (`g++` by default; override with `CXX=clang++`).
Builds use a temporary directory that is removed on exit. No root privileges,
live tunnel, or network access are needed.

- `replay_test.cpp`: reordered timestamps, duplicates, window eviction,
  integer boundaries, and reassembly of 64 fragments received in reverse order.
- `mac_test.cpp`: independent Ascon permutation comparisons, custom MAC
  vectors, v2/v3 tampering checks, and the XOR forgery regression.

These are regression checks, not a security proof of the custom MAC.

`pmtud-iptables-test.sh` is a separate, manual integration helper that changes
firewall rules and requires root. It is deliberately not run by `run.sh`.
